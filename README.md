# TicTacToe
Simple Tic Tac Toe program in html and JavaScript

A 3x3 grid with editable will be shown on the browser when the file TicTacToeHtml is launched.
Currently it works only for numbers (choose only two variants in numbers like 0 and 1)
When the grid is filled with two different numbers, click on button "Who wins?"
It will display the results as following (assuming three of the marks/numbers is matched to 1)
1. When row is matched: "Winner is => 1"
2. When column is matched: "Winner is | 1"
3. When right angled diagonal is matched: "Winner is \ 1"
4. When left angled diagonal is matched: "Winner is / 1"

How to play?
1. Fill the grid with two different numbers, say player A fills 1 and player B as 0
2. Once filled, just click on the button "Who wins?"
3. Ta-da..! You got the result of winner.

Improvements
------------
1. Need to make the grid autofill after player A fills or marks by some symbox say 'X' (so, changing to symbol from number is required)
2. Need to separate the JavaScript code from html.
3. Add CSS to make it more interative
4. Using any single page JS framework would also be a good idea.
5. Fixing the bugs if any!
